# PSCF+ -- Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory (C++/CUDA) with Improved and Extended Capabilities
PSCF+ is a software package for solving the polymer self-consistent field (SCF) theory in continuum. It is based on the nice GPU framework of [PSCF](https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp) (which is only for the "standard" or known as the Edwards-Helfand model, *i.e.*, incompressible melts of continuous Gaussian chains with the Dirac $\delta$-function interactions, commonly used in polymer field theories) originally developed by Prof. David Morse and co-workers, but is improved with better numerical methods, less GPU memory usage and more flexible algorithms, and is extended to various discrete-chain models. Similar to the C++/CUDA version of PSCF, PSCF+ described here is written primarily in C++, with GPU accelerated code in CUDA. Please see the [user manual](https://github.com/qwcsu/pscfplus/blob/master/doc/pdf/refman.pdf) for details.
