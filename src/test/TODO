TODO:

- Add ability to do regression tests based on small text strings stored 
  in files, to remove/minimize the need for human inspection of unit test 
  results.

- Add ifdefs to makefiles and test composite code to allow the correct
  tests to be run when compiled with MPI enabled or disabled.
