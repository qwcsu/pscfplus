USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

This directory contains three simple usage examples for the unit test 
framework:

example1 constructs and runs a UnitTestRunner. 
example2 constructs and runs a CompositeTestRunner for two unit tests.

example3 is compiled only if TEST_MPI is defined, and demonstrates use 
of a UnitTestRunner for an MPI job.

COMPILATION
-----------

To compile the examples:

1) Before the first time you attempt to compile cd to the examples
directory and invoke the command

> ./setup

You should only have to do this once.  This creates a new file named
config.mk.

Note: The setup command simply copies the file config.mk_r to create
a file named config.mk.  The config.mk_r file is the default repository 
version of the configuration file, whereas config.mk is the user copy. 
After setup, users may edit the file config.mk to set up the compiler 
command or compiler options, but should avoid modifying config.mk_r.

2) Eneter:

> make all
